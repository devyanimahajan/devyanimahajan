I'm a data scientist and **MS Applied Data Science** student at the **University of Chicago**, passionate about designing AI/ML systems that deliver measurable value. I’ve built data-driven products across asset allocation, retail forecasting, speech science research, and more, leveraging deep learning, statistical modelling, LLM fine-tuning, and cloud-based workflows. I care about creating accurate, scalable machine learning solutions that align with real user needs and solve real problems.
