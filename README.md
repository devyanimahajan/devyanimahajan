I'm a data scientist and an **MS Applied Data Science** student at the **University of Chicago**, passionate about making machine learning and AI more interpretable, impactful, and accessible.  I've implemented data-driven solutions across finance, e-commerce, and scientific research, and I hope to continue applying statistical reasoning, prompt engineering, and deep learning to solve complex real-world problems.
